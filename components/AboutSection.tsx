              I am a recent graduate from the University of the East, Manila. My
              educational background has equipped me with a solid foundation in
              various aspects of computer engineering, including programming
              languages (C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, and PHP), computer
              architecture, database management systems (DBMS), circuit design,
              network security, technopreneurship, and embedded systems.
              Throughout my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience
              in designing and implementing software solutions, understanding
              hardware components, optimizing database performance, developing
              secure network infrastructures, and designing efficient embedded
              systems.

              I have a wide range of hobbies that keeps me occupied. From
              reading, playing sports, to working out at the gym. I am always
              seeking new experiences and love to keep myself engaged and
              learning new things.

              professional life. My dedication to technology is matched only by
              my fervent commitment to tackling intricate challenges and
              constantly pushing the boundaries. I embrace challenges as
              opportunities for growth, both as a professional and as an
              individual, always eager to expand my horizons and enhance my
              skill set.
